Read missing-tests.md and implement the identified test cases.

For each missing test:
1. Locate the relevant file and test directory
2. Write the test case based on the specification in missing-tests.md
3. Run the test to verify it fails (or that it passes if code is already correct)
4. Ensure the test covers the scenario described
5. Commit changes with a message referencing the test added

After all tests are implemented:
1. Delete missing-tests.md
2. Run the full test suite to ensure all tests pass
3. Report which tests were added and any that were deferred/skipped with explanation
