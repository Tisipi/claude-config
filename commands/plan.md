Read the spec.md file and create a detailed implementation plan.

Break down the work into small, incremental prompts. Each prompt should:
- Be self-contained and completable in one step
- Include writing tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
- Build progressively on previous steps
- Have no orphaned code - everything integrates

Generate two files:
1. prompt_plan.md - Step-by-step implementation prompts in markdown, each clearly separated
2. todo.md - Checkbox checklist for tracking progress

Prioritize best practices and testing at each stage.
