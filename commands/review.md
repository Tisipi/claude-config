Use a subagent to carefully review all new code written in the current session and any existing code that was modified.

Look for:
- Logic errors and bugs
- Edge cases not handled
- Code clarity and maintainability issues (clean code!)
- Missing error handling
- Performance problems
- Security vulnerabilities
- Inconsistencies with project conventions

Document findings in `review-comments.md` with:
1. File path and line number for each issue
2. Category (bug, clarity, performance, etc.)
3. Description of the problem
4. Suggested fix

Save the file even if no issues are found.
